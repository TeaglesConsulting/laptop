Laptop
======

Laptop is a script to set up a Mac OS X (not Linux... for now) laptop for Rails development.

Requirements
------------

### Mac OS X

Install a C compiler:

For Snow Leopard (10.6): use [OS X GCC
Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/).

For Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8): use [Command Line Tools for
XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action).

For Mavericks (10.9): run `sudo xcodebuild -license` and follow the instructions
to accept the XCode agreement.  Then run `xcode-select --install` in your
terminal and then click "Install".

Install
-------

### Mac OS X

Read, then run the script:

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeaglesConsulting/laptop/master/mac)

What it sets up
---------------

* Zsh as your shell
* Bundler gem for managing Ruby libraries
* Foreman gem for serving Rails apps locally
* Homebrew for managing operating system libraries (OS X only)
* ImageMagick for cropping and resizing images
* Postgres for storing relational data
* Qt for headless JavaScript testing via Capybara Webkit
* Rails gem for writing web applications
* Rbenv for managing versions of the Ruby programming language
* Redis for storing key-value data
* Ruby Build for installing Rubies
* Ruby stable for writing general-purpose code
* Watch for periodically executing a program and displaying the output

It should take less than 15 minutes to install (depends on your machine).

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in `~/.laptop.local`. For example, your
`~/.laptop.local` might look like this:

    #!/bin/sh

    brew tap phinze/homebrew-cask
    brew install brew-cask

    brew cask install dropbox
    brew cask install google-chrome
    brew cask install rdio
